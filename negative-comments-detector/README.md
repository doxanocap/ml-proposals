# Negative Comments & Argument Analysis

This module focuses on the detection and analysis of argumentative structures in text, utilizing the UKP Convincing Arguments and ChangeMyView datasets.

## Overview

The primary goal is to distinguish between high-quality, persuasive arguments and lower-quality or negative contributions. The notebook explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and preliminary modeling steps.

## Components

- **Data Loading**: Scripts to load and parse UKP and CMV datasets.
- **Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, handling of delta/non-delta comments.
- **Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of argument features.

## Usage

The main analysis is contained within `main.ipynb`.

```bash
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```
